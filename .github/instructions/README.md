## üöÄ GETTING STARTED

### Prerequisites:
```bash
# Required tools
python 3.11+
docker
node.js 18+
git

# AI API access
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Blockchain access
export POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC="https://..."
export CHAINLINK_TESTNET_URL="https://..."
```

### Initial Setup:
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/steamnoid/whispr.git
cd whispr
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install minimal dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic openai httpx cryptography

# 3. Start with TDD - write first test
mkdir tests
touch tests/test_ai_rewriter.py

# 4. Begin Week 1 development
echo "Starting Week 1: AI Core + Cryptographic Foundation"
```

### First Test (TDD Mandatory):
```python
# tests/test_ai_rewriter.py
def test_ai_rewriter_removes_profanity():
    """First test: AI must remove profanity in professional rewrites"""
    from ai_rewriter import rewrite_message
    
    raw = "This fucking deadline is bullshit!"
    result = rewrite_message(raw, "professional", "colleagues")
    
    assert len(result) >= 3  # Must return 3 alternatives
    assert all("fuck" not in alt.text.lower() for alt in result)
    assert all("bullshit" not in alt.text.lower() for alt in result)
    assert all(len(alt.text) > 10 for alt in result)  # Meaningful rewrites

# This test will fail - implement minimal code to pass
```

## üîÑ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Daily Routine:
1. **Morning**: Review previous day's minimalism metrics
2. **TDD Cycle**: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor (30-min cycles)
3. **Real AI Testing**: No mocks, test with actual models
4. **Evening**: Delete unused code, update metrics

### Weekly Milestones:
- **Week 1**: Core AI + Crypto working locally
- **Week 2**: Chainlink testnet integration
- **Week 3**: Production hardening
- **Week 4**: Web3 ecosystem integration
- **Week 5**: Mainnet preparation
- **Week 6**: Public launch

### Quality Gates:
- All tests pass before any commit
- <200 lines per file (enforced)
- <10 dependencies total (enforced)
- >95% test coverage (enforced)
- Real AI models tested daily

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Technical KPIs:
- **Response Time**: <2000ms (AI rewrites)
- **Throughput**: >1000 req/s per node
- **Uptime**: >99.9%
- **Code Quality**: >95% test coverage
- **Security**: Zero vulnerabilities

### Business KPIs:
- **Users**: >1000 DAU by Week 6
- **Volume**: >10k messages/day by Week 6
- **Revenue**: >$10k/month by Week 6
- **Satisfaction**: >95% user approval

### Web3 KPIs:
- **TVL**: >$1M by Week 6
- **Node Operators**: >50 by Week 6
- **Cross-chain**: >20% volume
- **DAO Participation**: >10% token holders

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Non-Negotiable Rules:
1. **Zero unnecessary code** - Delete ruthlessly
2. **E2E-first** - Start with real AI, not mocks
3. **TDD mandatory** - No code without tests
4. **Stateless design** - No persistent storage
5. **Web3-native** - Crypto proofs for everything

### Immediate Failures:
- Any file >200 lines
- Any untested code
- Any unused dependency
- Any mock in E2E tests
- Any feature without user request

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOLS AND AUTOMATION

### Development Tools:
```bash
# Code quality
pip install pytest black mypy vulture radon

# Testing
pip install pytest-asyncio pytest-cov httpx

# Security
pip install bandit safety

# Performance
pip install locust artillery
```

### CI/CD Automation:
- Pre-commit hooks enforce minimalism
- All tests run on every commit
- Security scans on every PR
- Performance tests on release branches
- Automated deployment to staging

## üìä MONITORING AND METRICS

### Daily Metrics:
- Lines of code (should decrease)
- Test coverage (should increase)
- Performance benchmarks
